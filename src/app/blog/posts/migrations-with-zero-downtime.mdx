## Core moves

- Dual-write → verify → cutover
- Backfill with idempotent jobs
- Feature flags for progressive exposure

## Plan skeleton

<CodeBlock
  marginBottom="16"
  codes={[
    {
      code:
`# migrate.md
1. Add dual-write (old + new store)
2. Ship read-through cache for new store
3. Backfill historical data (chunked, retryable)
4. Shadow reads + compare metrics
5. Flip reads to new store (flag)
6. Decommission old writes`,
      language: "markdown",
      label: "docs/migrate.md"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Telemetry

- Compare P95 latency, error rate, and data drift before/after cutover
