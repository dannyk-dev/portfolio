## Calculator

<CodeBlock
  marginBottom="16"
  highlight="9-16"
  codes={[
    {
      code:
`// buildVsBuy.ts
type Inputs = {
  seats: number; saasMonthly: number; pluginsMonthly: number;
  buildCapex: number; monthlyOps: number; months: number;
};
export function buildVsBuy(x: Inputs) {
  const buy = (x.saasMonthly + x.pluginsMonthly) * x.months;
  const build = x.buildCapex + (x.monthlyOps * x.months);
  const delta = buy - build;
  return { buy, build, delta, roi: delta / Math.max(1, build) };
}
// Example: buildVsBuy({seats:40, saasMonthly:1200, pluginsMonthly:300, buildCapex:60000, monthlyOps:800, months:24})`,
      language: "ts",
