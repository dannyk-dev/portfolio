## Why this matters

Speed to learning beats speed to launch. Our MVP process compresses risk by validating real demand in weeks, not months.

## The 6-week plan

| Week | Focus | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Discovery + success metrics | Scope, risks, KPI baseline |
| 2 | UX flows + data model | Clickable prototype, schema |
| 3 | Foundations | CI/CD, auth, design system |
| 4 | Core features | Tested vertical slice |
| 5 | Integrations | Payments, email, analytics |
| 6 | UAT + launch | Pilot, feedback loop |

## MVP acceptance gates

- One clear revenue or usage KPI
- A vertical slice that exercises auth, data, UI, and one critical flow
- Rollback + logging + analytics in place
