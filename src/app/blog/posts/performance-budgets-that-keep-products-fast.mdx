## Why budgets

What gets measured gets maintained. Budgets align design, engineering, and product.

## Budget template

<CodeBlock
  marginBottom="16"
  highlight="4-8"
  codes={[
    {
      code:
`{
  "LCP_ms": 1800,
  "INP_ms": 150,
  "bundle_kb": 180,
  "img_kb": 300,
  "api_p95_ms": 400,
  "error_rate_pct": 0.5
}`,
      language: "json",
      label: "perf/budget.json"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Guardrails

- CI check fails if budgets regress
- Per-route RUM dashboards
- Image/CDN policies baked into the design system
